# Popular-Movies-Stage-1-
This repo contains code for my project for Udacity's Android Nanodegree Program.
It Presents the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
original title
movie poster image thumbnail
A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
user rating (called vote_average in the api)
release date
PS-You need to add your API key in the file named GridViewActivity.java.You can get your own API key by registering at https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup
